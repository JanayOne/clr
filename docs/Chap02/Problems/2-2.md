# 2-2 Correctness of bubblesort

> Bubblesort is a popular, but inefficient, sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are out of order. The procedure **BUBBLESORT** sorts array $A[1:n]$.

>               exchange A[j] with A[j-1]

## **a**

$A'$ consist of all the elements of $A$

## **b**

**loop invariant**: At the start of each iteration of $for$ loop in lines 2-4, $A[j:n]$ consist of the elements originally in $A[j:n]$ before entering the loop but possibly in a different order, and $A[j]$ is the smallest one of them.

**Initialization**: $j=n$, $A[n]$ consist of the elements originally in A$[n]$ and it is the smallest.

**Maintenance**: During the iteration, if$A[j-1]<A[j]$, we swap them. So A[j-1] will be the smallest and A[j-1:n] consist of the elements originally in $A[j-1:n]$. Decresementing j preserves the **loop invariant**.

**Termination**: the loop terminates  when $j = i$, $A[i:n]$ consist of the elements originally in $A[i:n]$ before entering the loop but possibly in a different order, and $A[i]$ is the smallest one of them.

## **c**

**Loop invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop of lines 1-4, the subarray $A[1..i − 1]$ consists of the $i - 1$ smallest elements in $A[1..n]$ in sorted order. $A[i..n]$ consists of the $n - i + 1$ remaining elements in $A[1..n]$.

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray $A[1..i − 1]$ is empty and trivially this is the smallest element of the subarray.

**Maintenance:** From part (b), after the execution of the inner loop, $A[i]$ will be the smallest element of the subarray $A[i..n]$. And in the beginning of the outer loop, $A[1..i − 1]$ consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $A[i..n]$, in sorted order. So, after the execution of the outer loop, subarray $A[1..i]$ will consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $A[i + 1..n]$, in sorted order.

**Termination:** The loop terminates when $i = A.length$. At that point the array $A[1..n]$ will consists of all elements in sorted order.

## **d**

The $i$th iteration of the **for** loop of lines 1-4 will cause $n − i$ iterations of the **for** loop of lines 2-4, each with constant time execution, so the worst-case running time of bubble sort is $\Theta(n^2)$ which is same as the worst-case running time of insertion sort.
