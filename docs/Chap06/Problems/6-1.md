# 6-1 Building a heap using insertion

> One way to build a heap is by repeatedly calling **MAX-HEAP-INSERT** to insert the elements into the heap. Consider the procedure **BUILD-MAX-HEAP'** on the facing page. It assumes that the objects being inserted are just the heap elements.
>
> ```cpp
> BUILD-MAX-HEAP'(A,n)
>   A.heap-size = 1
>   for i = 2 to n
>       MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A,A[i],n)
> ```
>
> **a**. Do the procedures **BUILD-MAX-HEAP** and **BUILD-MAX-HEAP'** always create the same heap when run on the same input array? Prove that they do, or provide a counterexample.
>
> **b**. Show that in the worst case, **BUILD-MAX-HEAP'** requires $\Theta(n \lg n)$ time to build an $n$-element heap.

## **a**

No. For a countereaxmple, $A = <1,2,3>$.

**BUILD-MAX-HEAP** returns $A = <3,2,1>$.

While **BUILD-MAX-HEAP'** returns $A = <3,1,2>$.

## **b**

In the worst case, `MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A,A[i],n)` require $\Theta(\lg i)$, then we have **BUILD-MAX-HEAP'** requires:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T(n)
    & = \sum_{i=2}^{n}\Theta(\lg i)\cr
    & = \Theta(\lg \prod_{i=2}^{n}i)\cr
    & = \Theta(\lg (n!))\cr
    & = \Theta(n\lg n)\cr
\end{aligned}
$$
