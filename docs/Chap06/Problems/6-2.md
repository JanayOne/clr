# 6-2 Analysis of $d$-ary heaps

> A **_$d$-ary heap_** is like a binary heap, but (with one possible exception) nonleaf nodes have $d$ children instead of two children. In all parts of this problem, assume that the time to maintain the mapping between objects and heap elements is $O(1)$ per operation.

## **a**

The array can be described by the following two fuctions to get the index of parent of $i$-th element in the array  and the $j$-th child of $i$-th element.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    CHILD(i+1,j) & = CHILD(i)+d\cr
    CHILD(1,j) & = j+1 \quad 1\leq j \leq n\cr
    \implies CHILD(i,j) & = d(i-1)+j+1 \quad 1\leq j \leq n\cr
    \implies PARENT(i) & = floor((i-2)/d) + 1\cr
\end{aligned}
$$

## **b**

Let $max(h)$ be the maximum numbers of elements in a $d$-ary heap of height $h$? Let $h(n)$ be the height of $d$-ary heap of $n$ elements.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    max(h)
    & = \sum_{i=0}^{h} d^i\cr
    & = \frac{d^{h+1}-1}{d-1}\cr
    h(n)
    & = \Theta(\log_{d}h)\cr
    & = \Theta(\lg n)\cr
\end{aligned}
$$

## **c**

```cpp
D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX(A)
    max = A[1]
    A[1] = A[n]
    A.heap-size = A.heap-size - 1
    D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-HEAPIFY(A,1)//Θ(d*lg(n))
    return max

//
D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-HEAPIFY(A,i)
    find the index j of the largest child of A[i]//Θ(d)
    if j != i
    exchange A[i] and A[j]
    i = j
    D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-HEAPIFY(A,i)//Θ(lg n) times' calling
```

The running time of **EXTRACT-MAX** $\Theta(d\lg n)$.

## **d**

```cpp
D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A,x,k)
    if k < x.key
        error "new key is smaller than current key"
    find the index i in array A where object x occurs
    while i > 1 and A[i].key < A[PARENT(i)].key
        exchange A[i] and A[PARENT(i)]
        update relative information
        i = PARENT(i)
```

The number of `while` loop iteration is the depth of the node which donates x. So the running time is $O(D)=O(\log_{d} n)$

## **e**

```cpp
D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-INSERT(A,x,n)
    if A.heap-size == n
        error "heap overflow"
    A.heap-size = A.heap-size + 1
    k = x.key
    A[A.heap-size] = x
    x.key = -∞
    update the map between objects and array
    D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A,x,k)
```

The running time is domained by `D-ARY-MAX-HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A,x,k)`. So it is $O(\log_{d} n)$
